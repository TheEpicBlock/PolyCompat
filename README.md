# PolyCompat
A companion to the [PolyMc](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc) project.

Whilst PolyMc attempts to automate as much of the process as possible. There are still some things that just can't easily be automated.  
That's what this mod is for. To make features from mods accessible in a way that can be understood by the vanilla client manually.
